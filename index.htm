<p>A step by step guide to help you optimize your webpages.</p>

<h5><strong>Why I selected "Search Engine Optimization for my topic?</strong></h5>
<p> You can create a great website, but what good is it if no  one visits it. That&rsquo;s the thing, it is just as important. Students need to  understand that utilization is critical for a website to succeed and meet the  objectives it was designed to meet. If it does not display at the top of the  list, it has less probability of being used. Students need to incorporate best  practices for SOE when designing/developing a website. </p>

<p><a href=Òpages/what_is_seo.htmÓ>What is SEO?</a>
</p>
<p>SOE stands for ÒSearch Engine OptimizationÓ. Basically, it  answers the question &ldquo;When someone searches for something in a search engine.  ie: Google? How well will it find what your looking for, how fast will it find  it, and where will it display when presented to you? Ie: top, middle, bottom?  Side?; All the answers to these questions  is why designing and developing a website that maximizes optimization is so  important. How important? That depends on you, your business, and why you  created a website in the first place. </p>

  How do we achieve “Search Engine Optimization”?</a>
<p>Well, basically, there are a bunch of people that dedicated  themselves to identifying the best way to achieve this goal. If you do some  research on the topic, you will quickly realize that &ldquo;Best Practices&rdquo; may vary.  So donÕt get stuck on being perfect, no website is.. but hey, letÕs do the best  we can to make it as optimal as possible. WouldnÕt you agree? Below are some of  the important concepts you should consider when designing/developing your  website.
<p>

<p><strong>Exercise:</strong> Research different websites and find one that does not follow these recommended  guidelines. Provide the domain name, folder name, and webpage name for each  infraction. Provide your recommendation on how to optimize it and explain why?  Hint: search for something&hellip;then go to a website on the bottom of the list.  Figure out why it is appearing at the bottom. What can you change to help it  appear higher in the list?

<p><strong>Assessment: </strong> I would create a rubric to grade this type of activity. </p>
